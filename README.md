 ## What is this and what was this built for?

 SuperHelper was built for the purpose of improving the developer experience on OP stack and its L2s including Zora, Mode, Base and even custom chains that can be added by the developer.
 Contract deployment, verification and interaction is a time-consuming process and can result in the loss of private keys as well. That's why we built these tools while also providing an interactive user experience. 

 ## What are these tools?
 Explore: Allows developers to interact with their smart contracts by just pasting their contract addresses. 
 
 Deploy: Allows developers to easily deploy their smart contracts and also takes care of the compilation of them, so that developers do not have to write any scripts for deploying the smart contracts. 
 
 Verify: This feature helps developers verify their already deployed smart contracts in a single click. It also attests to the smart contract using EAS. 
 
 CLI-tools: It allow developers to perform all these functionality, simply from their terminal.
